# Microservices Patterns: What You Need to Know to Build Scalable Systems

If you've started moving away from monoliths or are thinking about it, **microservices** probably seem like the way to go. But splitting your application into smaller parts isn't enough. You need the right patterns to make them work reliably and at scale.

In this post, I'll guide you through the key **microservices patterns** to help you build scalable and quieter systems.

Let's dive in.

## Decomposition Patterns

These patterns help you organize services in a way that makes sense and remains manageable.

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** helps group logic around actual business needs.
* **Bounded Contexts** give each service a clear responsibility.
* With **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**, each user interface gets its own custom API.

## Integration Patterns

* An **API Gateway** or **Facade** simplifies access for external users.
* Use **Choreography** when services communicate on their own.
* Choose **Orchestration** when one service controls the flow.
* Add **Service Mesh**, **Service Registration**, and **Discovery** to handle communication and service lookup behind the scenes.

## Configuration Patterns

* Keep **configurations external** to avoid redeploying for small changes.
* Use a **centralized configuration store** if you need consistent settings.
* Go **Distributed** when each service needs to operate more independently.

## Versioning Patterns

Let services evolve without breaking things.

* **Semantic Versioning** provides a structured approach to managing changes.
* **API Versioning** helps clients continue working while you update things behind the scenes.

## Database Patterns

* Give each service its **own database** to reduce coupling.
* Use **CQRS** to separate commands from queries.
* Apply **Saga** and **Compensating Transactions** when you need to keep data consistent across services.

## Resilience Patterns

Services will fail. It's best to expect it and plan for it.

* Use **Retry** and **Circuit Breaker** to handle transient errors.
* Define **Timeouts** so services don't hang forever.
* Add **Fallbacks**, **Failover**, and **Redundancy** to improve uptime.

## Deployment Patterns

You want to release features with confidence, not fear.

* **Blue-Green** and **Canary Deployments** help reduce risk.
* Use **Feature Toggles** to test without deploying new code.
* Plan for **gradual releases** instead of **big-bang** releases.

## Observability Patterns

If you can't monitor your services, you can't support them.

* **Distributed Tracing** helps you follow requests across services.
* **Health Check APIs** and **Log Aggregation** help monitor service status.
* Add **Audit Logs**, **Event Correlation**, and **Chaos Engineering** to stay ahead of problems before users notice them.

## Security Patterns

* Cover the basics: **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Input Validation**.
* Add **Rate Limiting** and **Encryption** to protect data and performance.
* Use **OAuth**, **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control), and **Valet Key** for secure and controlled access.
