# API is Not a Microservice: Demystifying the Difference

Many people still get confused: **API is not a microservice**. And that's okay â€” let's break this down once and for all.

## The Restaurant Analogy

To understand the difference simply, imagine a **restaurant**:

| Technical Component | In the Restaurant | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The API** | **The Waiter/Server** | Takes your order, brings it to the kitchen (the services), and then delivers the finished plate (the final result). **You don't need to know what happened inside.** |
| **The Microservices** | **The Chefs/Cooks** | Each one has a specialty: one makes the pasta, another the sauce, another the salad. They work **independently** but in sync to assemble the dish. |

## How it Works in Practice

In software architecture, the flow is:

$$
\text{Your Application} \rightarrow \text{API (coordinates everything)} \rightarrow \text{Microservices (execute the tasks)}
$$

The **API** handles the **orchestration** and hides all the complexity of the microservices behind it, presenting a clean, single interface.

This analogy often helps a lot when explaining things to clients or non-technical teams.
