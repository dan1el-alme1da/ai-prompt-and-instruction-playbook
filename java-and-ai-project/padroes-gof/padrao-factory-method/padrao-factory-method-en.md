## 1\. Factory Method Design Pattern

### Observation and Problems with the Factory Method Pattern

The **Factory Method** design pattern aims to create objects, but it leaves the choice of which class to instantiate to the subclasses. This allows a class to delegate the responsibility of object creation to its subclasses.

Imagine the following problem in a data management system: you need to create objects of different data types, such as lists, sets, or maps, but the exact type can only be determined at runtime.

**What would be the problems if you used the `new` operator to instantiate objects?**

  * **Coupling:** The code would become highly coupled to concrete classes.
  * **Low Cohesion:** The main class would have to know the implementation details of the subclasses.
  * **Low Flexibility:** Adding new data types would require modifying the source code of the main class.

Instead of using the `new` operator directly, we can use a method to create objects, a method that is called the **Factory Method**.

```java
// Example code for the problem
public class DataManager {
    public void processData(String dataType) {
        // Problem: Coupling
        // By using "new" directly, the code is coupled to concrete classes
        if (dataType.equals("list")) {
            List data = new ArrayList(); // Creates an ArrayList
            data.add("Item 1");
            // ... processing
        } else if (dataType.equals("set")) {
            Set data = new HashSet(); // Creates a HashSet
            data.add("Item 1");
            // ... processing
        }
        // ... more types
    }
}
// ... concrete data classes
```

## 2\. Factory Method Design Pattern

### Factory Method Pattern Solution

This pattern defines a method responsible for purely instantiating and returning the object. A hierarchy of abstract classes or *interfaces* defines the basic structure, and the concrete classes implement the factory method to instantiate the specific objects.

Below is the class structure representing a generic interface called **Collection**. Here are examples of different implementations:

  * `ArrayList`
  * `LinkedList`
  * `HashSet`
  * `TreeSet`

The organization of these classes is based on a hierarchy.

**Class Diagram for the Collection organization:**
(Diagram shows that `List` and `Set` inherit from `Collection`. `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` inherit from `List`. `HashSet` and `TreeSet` inherit from `Set`.)

The **Collection** hierarchy applies a structure called `Iterable`. Implementations in each specific data structure, such as `ArrayList` or `HashSet`, implement the **Iterable** *interface*.

The **Iterable** interface has a method called `iterator()`, which returns an **Iterator**.

An **Iterator** is an object that allows iteration over a collection of objects, without exposing the details of its organization. The `iterator()` method is a **Factory Method** that returns the **Iterator** object for each class that implements the `Collection` interface, as can be seen in the image below:

**Class Diagram for the Iterator/Factory Method pattern:**
(Diagram shows that `ArrayListIterator`, `LinkedListIterator`, `KeyIterator`, and `ValueIterator` implement the `Iterator` interface and are returned by `iterator()` methods of classes like `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`, etc. This structure illustrates the Factory Method.)

Thus, what would be done, in a tightly coupled way, with the use of `new` in `ArrayList` or in a `LinkedList` instantiating a `ListIterator`, is done by a method that delegates the responsibility of creation to a subclass, following the **Factory Method** pattern.

Now, in the code below, you can see the implementation of the concrete class hierarchy using this **Factory Method**:

```java
// Example code of the implementation
public abstract class DataManager {
    // Factory Method: Creates a data object (Product)
    public abstract DataObject createDataObject(); 

    public void processData() {
        DataObject data = createDataObject();
        data.addData("Item 1");
        // ... processing
    }
}

public class ListManager extends DataManager {
    @Override
    public DataObject createDataObject() {
        return new ArrayListDataObject();
    }
}
// ...
```

The **Factory Method** is not just the method that instantiates an object, but also the concept of a *framework* that defines the responsibility of creation for concrete classes. By using it, we are in compliance with the **Open/Closed Principle**, as we can add new concrete *product* classes (created objects) without modifying the code of the *creator* (the class that contains the Factory Method).

**General diagram of the solution proposed by the Factory Method pattern:**
(Diagram showing the **Factory Method** structure with the **Product**, **Creator**, **ConcreteProduct**, and **ConcreteCreator** classes.)

Note that the general structure of the solution proposed by the **Factory Method** pattern defines four participants:

1.  **Product:** Defines the *interface* of the objects to be created.
2.  **Creator:** Declares the **Factory Method**, which returns an object of the **Product** type. The *Creator* defines the method, but the implementation is left to the subclass.
3.  **ConcreteProduct:** Implements the **Product** *interface*.
4.  **ConcreteCreator:** Overrides the **Factory Method** to return an instance of **ConcreteProduct**.

### Consequences and Related Patterns to the Factory Method

The main consequence of using the **Factory Method** is the increase in **extensibility**, as new **ConcreteProduct** classes can be added without the need to modify the code of the **Creator** classes. This promotes **low coupling** and **high cohesion**.

It also allows the power of object creation to be combined with other patterns, such as **Strategy**, which defines specific strategies for each concrete type, or **Template Method**, which controls common creation steps in subclasses.

Explore the following topics on consequences and patterns related to the **Factory Method**.

The **Factory Method** pattern allows different implementations of the same service to be used.

Furthermore, this pattern enables the connection of two parallel hierarchies represented by the generic participants **Creator** and **Product**.

\<h4\>Tip\</h4\>
The **Factory Method** is very useful when we need to segregate a hierarchy of different objects into separate hierarchies. This guarantees low coupling and flexibility for the classes that interact with this information.
\</div\>

The **Factory Method** pattern can be applied in conjunction with the **Strategy** pattern, which aims to define different behaviors or algorithms for concrete classes.

**Template Method** is another pattern frequently used together with the **Factory Method**. It is a generic implementation defined in a superclass that contains steps that can be overridden by subclasses. The **Factory Method** can be one of these steps, where the superclass defines that an object will be created, but the subclass decides which one.

Below is a code that demonstrates the combination between **Factory Method** and **Strategy**.

```java
// Example code of Factory Method + Strategy
public abstract class PagamentoStrategy {
    public abstract void pagar(double valor); 
}

public class CartaoCreditoStrategy extends PagamentoStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pagar(double valor) {
        System.out.println("Pagamento com Cartão de Crédito: " + valor); // Payment with Credit Card
    }
}

// ... Other strategies

public abstract class PagamentoFactory {
    // Factory Method
    public abstract PagamentoStrategy criarPagamento(); // createPayment
}

public class CartaoCreditoFactory extends PagamentoFactory {
    @Override
    public PagamentoStrategy criarPagamento() {
        return new CartaoCreditoStrategy();
    }
}

// Use of the combination
public class Pedido { // Order
    private PagamentoFactory factory;
    private double valor; // value

    public Pedido(PagamentoFactory factory, double valor) {
        this.factory = factory;
        this.valor = valor;
    }

    public void processarPagamento() { // processPayment
        PagamentoStrategy strategy = factory.criarPagamento(); // Factory Method
        strategy.pagar(valor); // Strategy
    }
}
```
